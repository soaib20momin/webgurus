We monitor, review, store and analyze your content (including your resumes, cover letters, applications, messages, questionnaire answers, responses, offer letters and other materials) that you send, store or receive, including via automated means and otherwise, for data analysis, quality control, and to refine the Site or any other <b><i>Careerinsights</i></b> product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for job seekers and employers, provide you with personally relevant product features, and to prevent and block fraud and spam or reduce unwanted mail).&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;When communicating through <b><i>Careerinsights</i></b>’s relay system, you will see an email address with an&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">@<b><i>Careerinsights</i></b>email.com&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or @<b><i>Careerinsights</i></b>mail.com ending.
